# Logistic_Regression_Advanced_Case_Study
Case study to work through the math behind logistic regression using sklearn.

## Biggest Challenge
Getting Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to work with all my already existing local setup (Pycharm, Conda, etc). This made this project more complicated than expected because I'm using several different tools and setups for learning purposes. At least some of these are not recommended on Windows.
